              We value your documentation contributions, and we want to make it
              as easy as possible to work in this repository. One of the first
              things to decide is which branch to base your work on. If you get
              confused, just ask and we will help. If a reviewer realizes you
              have based your work on the wrong branch, we'll let you know so
              that you can rebase it.

            <p>
              Most commits will be made against the <code>master</code> branch.
              This include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Conceptual and task-based information not specific to new
                features
              </li>
              <li>Restructuring / rewriting</li>
              <li>Doc bug fixing</li>
              <li>Typos and grammar errors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              One quirk of this project is that the<code>master</code> branch is
              where the live docs are published from, so upcoming features can't
              be documented there. See Specific new features for a project for
              how to document upcoming features. These feature branches will be
              periodically merged with <code>master</code>, so don't worry about
              fixing typos and documentation bugs there.

              then importing a project's <code>master</code> branch's docs into

              For every PR against <code>master</code> and all the long-lived
              branches, a staged version of the site is built using Netlify. If
              the site builds, you will see
              <strong>deploy/netlify — Deploy preview ready</strong>. Otherwise,
              you will see an error. Click <strong>Details</strong> to review
              the staged site or the errors that prevented it from building.
              Review the staged site and amend your commit if necessary.
              Reviewers will also check the staged site before merging the PR,
              to protect the integrity of
              <a href="https://docs.docker.com/">https://docs.docker.com/</a>.

            <p>You have three options:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>1. Clone this repo and run our staging container:</li>
              <code
                >git clone https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io.git</code
              >
              <code> cd docker.github.io</code>
              <code> docker-compose up</code>

              </p>
              <p>
                The container runs in the background and incrementally rebuilds
                the site each time a file changes. You can keep your browser
                open to
                <a href="http://localhost:4000/">http://localhost:4000/</a> and
                refresh to see your changes. The container runs in the
                foreground, but you can use <code>CTRL+C</code> to get the
                command prompt back. To stop the container, issue the following
                command:
              </p>
              <code>docker-compose down</code>

                <li>
                  g. Use the <code>jekyll serve</code> command to continuously
                  build the HTML output.

                <p>
                  The <code>jekyll serve</code> process runs in the foreground,

                  default. To stop it, use <code>CTRL+C</code>. You can continue
                  working in a second terminal and Jekyll will rebuild the
                  website incrementally. Refresh the browser to preview your

              Feel free to link to <code>../foo.md</code> so that the docs are
              readable in GitHub, but keep in mind that Jekyll templating
              notation <code>{% such as this %}</code> will render in raw text
              and not be processed. In general it's best to assume the docs are
              being read directly on
              <a href="https://docs.docker.com/">https://docs.docker.com/</a>.

              YAML content. The following keys are supported. The title,
              description, and keywords are required.

            <h3>Creating tabs</h3>
            <p>
              The use of tabs, as on pages like
              <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/"
                >https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/</a
              >, requires the use of HTML. The tabs use Bootstrap CSS/JS, so
              refer to those docs for more advanced usage. For a basic
              horizontal tab set, copy/paste starting from this code and
              implement from there. Keep an eye on those
              <code>href="#id" and id="id"</code> references as you rename, add,
              and remove tabs.
